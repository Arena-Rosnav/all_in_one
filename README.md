This repository contains the results of work presented in [All-in-One: A DRL-based Control Switch Combining State-of-the-art Navigation Planners](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.11636.pdf). The All-In-One Planner (AIO) chooses from a given list of local planners in each iteration with the objective to combine the strengths of learning-based planners and classical planners like TEB / MPC.

Currently we offer a control policy for 4 different robot models:
- Turtlebot3 Burger
- Jackal
- Robotino
- Youbot  

This code is intended for usage with Arena-Rosnav infrastructure.
For more information regarding AIO please refer to the [original repository](https://github.com/ignc-research/all-in-one-DRL-planner).
